The world's second-most populous country is running out of water. About 100 million people across India are on the front lines of a nationwide water crisis. A total of 21 major cities are poised to run out of groundwater next year, according to a 2018 report by government-run think tank NITI Aayog. In coming years, water, the necessity of life, is possibly to pose greatest challenge of its increased use with population rise, industrial development, and decreasing supplies due to pollution and over exploitation. Thus, the smart water metering system is indeed required, and it will make the user aware of their water consumption and help them to reduce their water usage. Again, the Internet of Things (IoT) is now considered the most promising technology to create powerful industrial and domestic applications. In this project, we develop an integrated Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for smart water meter networks to be deployed in smart cities, which can measure the flow and quality of the water by utilizing the water flow sensor (YF-S201) and turbidity sensor (TS-300B). Moreover, the developed system is also integrated with the mobile application for accessing both of the parties, i.e., users and administrators. As data will be stored and analyzed on the cloud, this system will be very economical. Also, users can access, analyze, and share data anytime, from anywhere.
